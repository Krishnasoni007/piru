                <h2 class="display-5 fw-bold mb-3">Who Should Conduct Exit Interviews? In-house vs. Third Party</h2>
                <p>When an employee is leaving, the organization needs to find out why. There can be many reasons ranging from work culture to better opportunities, but pinpointing the exact reason is a difficult task.</p>
                <p>Leaving and quitting arise from a lot of uncertain situations. In the dynamic work environment, nothing is fixed neither the employer nor the employee. Hiring new employees costs way higher than retaining the existing ones.</p>
                <p>Long gone are the days when employees had to work in unfavorable conditions. With myriad opportunities, people are quick to switch jobs for a better lifestyle. Hence, it is essential to conduct exit interviews and understand why the employee is leaving the company.</p>
                <p>However, the question is whom to ask. If you want to know what is happening in the organization, the exiting employees are the ones with the correct answers.</p>
                <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold mb-3">Who should conduct exit interviews?</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, organizations prefer to conduct exit interviews themselves. But these days, a lot of (ex-)employees are hesitant about in-house exit interviews. The reason being they do not want to be confronted or blamed. It is found out that companies conducting internal exit interviews only see a participation rate of around 15 to 20%.</p>
                <p>This significantly low number cannot help the company to gain valuable insights to improve the organization and the employee attrition rate. On top of that, a lot of time and resources are required to conduct exit interviews. It cannot be executed without proper planning.</p>
                <p>If a progressive procedure is not followed, it will just be a waste of resources. Apart from this, the HR department will unnecessarily have a lot on their plate because of the departing employee. Burdening them with a set of exit interviews is not a smart choice. Additionally, the guarantee of it being successful or helpful is negligible.</p>
                <h2 class="display-6 fw-bold mb-3">Why hire professionals to conduct exit interviews?</h2>
                <p>When it comes to exit interviews, just taking the interview won't suffice. Analyzing the feedback for actionable results is what the company is looking for. And if the results are unsatisfactory, the company won't be able to identify and work on the problematic areas.</p>
                <p>Hence, exit interviews require an effective strategic plan, from listing down the questions to compiling the results to form constructive feedback. It is only after this that the organization can work benefit after the employee leaves. It requires not just a great deal of time and proper execution, but also skill and technique. </p>
                <p>Hiring a third-party interview as a service platform like InCruiter will quickly help you gain meaningful results. At InCruiter, all the systems are in place to conduct exit interviews because they have been in the business for years.</p>
